OrderManager
============

This is the business' client for Qorder for the Windows OS.

How does this work
------------------

* **The client sends asynchronous requests to the web service.**<br>
  
* **If there are new orders, the client fetches them and previews them in the inbox section.**<br>
  
* **You can swap orders from the inbox to the serviced section or delete them.**<br>
